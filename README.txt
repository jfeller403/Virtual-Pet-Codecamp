BOREDOM: Your pets get bored over time, so you have to PLAY with them
         to keep them happy. To perform the PLAY action,
         navigate from the MAIN MENU to select one or all
         pets and select PLAY.



HUNGER:  Your pets get hungry over time, so you have to FEED them

         navigate from the MAIN MENU to select one or all
         pets and select FEED.



HEALTH METER: Your pets health level can get low, so you have to take them

              TAKE TO DOCTOR action navigate from the MAIN MENU 
              to select one or all pets and select TAKE TO DOCTOR action.



ROBOT PETS: They are the same as normal pets, other than being a robot 
            so HUNGER and HEALTH do not apply, but BATTERY and MAINTENANCE do!
	    Robot pets get added to the shelter and adopted just like the others.



BATTERY: Your robot pets' batteries get drained overtime, 
         so you have to CHARGE the to keep them running.
	 To perform the CHARGE action navigate from the MAIN MENU
	 to select one or all pets and select CHARGE.



MAINTENANCE: Your pet need regular maintenance over time, so you have to take them for MAINTENANCE 
             to keep them functioning properly. To perform the TAKE FOR MAINTENANCE action,
             navigate from the MAIN MENU to select the robopet pet and select TAKE FOR MAINTENANCE
	     


ADD PET TO SHELTER: When you first started, the shelter already contains a few dogs that need
	            your help.  To add to the brood, navigate FROM the MAIN MENU to select
	            ADD NEW PET TO THE SHELTER. Just enter the name and species of your pet
	            when asked.  (Note: RoboPets must be assigned the species ROBOT).



ADOPT PET: When you adopt a pet, you are removing your pet from the shelter (and the game)!
	   To adopt, navigate FROM the MAIN MENU to select ADOPT A PET.  Then just select your
	   pet.  The resulting change to the shelter can be checked by VIEWING STATUS...
 


VIEW STATUS: You should check in on the status of your pet(s) regularly in order
	     to keep them happy, healthy or maintained, and fed or charged. To perform 
	     the VIEW STATUS action, navigate FROM the MAIN MENU to select VIEW STATUS
	     OF ALL PETS.  This will give you a quick overview of how they're doing,
	     even for robopets!
